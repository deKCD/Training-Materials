<p>
The Machine Learning in Cloud Infrastructures learning pathway is designed for mastering training and deploying machine learning (ML) models in cloud infrastructure with emphasis on 1) practical cloud implementation (not on understanding ML algorithms), 2) focused on one robust model (XGBoost) that runs on both CPU and GPU, 3) ending with a capstone project (full cloud-based ML training pipeline).
