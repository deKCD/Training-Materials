# German Competence Center Cloud Technologies for Data Management and Processing (de.KCD)

<div class="justify-text">
    
<p>
de.KCD is a cross-location and cross-domain contact point for teaching skills in handling data using cloud-based technologies, resources and methods for institutions and networked centers as well as for researchers at all career levels.
</p>

<p>
In the current phase of digital transformation, scientific and economic success as well as the connectivity of future-oriented projects depend on (i) the systematic and structured collection of relevant raw and metadata through expertise-based data management, (ii) the development and provision of innovative cloud offerings and automated workflows, (iii) the development and transfer of expertise in the field of cloud-based data processing, and (iv) the availability of a powerful and independent cloud infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
The de.KCD specifically addresses these challenges in order to bundle expertise in cloud computing and data management, as well as to provide and expand the necessary hardware capacities and cloud services. The project implements suitable measures for cloud-based data management and standardized data analysis. It offers cloud infrastructure, storage and analysis options as well as generic training for knowledge transfer across different specialist areas. Virtual learning and working environments lower the barriers to access. In addition, technologies are being developed to answer complex research questions and integrate data from different disciplines. Beyond these measures, de.KCD also aims to promote collaboration and knowledge exchange between research locations by creating a networked, collaborative data space for national and international research projects.
