# What are scientific data?

## Scientific data?
All digital data used or generated in the research process.
- Raw and processed data
- Simulation data
- Observational data
- Code, algorithms, scripts
- Audiovisual data

## Meta data?
Structured data containing information about characteristics of other data.
- Who, When, Why, How
- Resources used
- Abbreviations, units, names used
- Licenses

# Common data types in microbiology
- Microbiome data
- Crystallographic data for small molecules
- Protein sequences
- Nucleic acid sequences
- Linked genotype and phenotype data
- Macromolecular structures
- Clinical data
- Functional genomics and gene expression data
- Standardised bacterial information

# Centralised repository for (meta)data standards
- Audience: the international microbiological community
- Content: easily accessible compilation of established standards 
- Aim: to facilitate efficient navigation and use for researchers involved in the collection and submission of (meta)data to public repositories
- Technical (e.g., sequencing method, sample volume or weight for DNA extraction, nucleic acid extraction, library size, etc.) 
  - Automatically generated by software associated to research instruments (see table)
  - Metadata acquisition can be partly configured in the software settings
  - Metadata export must sometimes be initiated deliberately
  - Biological and environmental metadata (e.g., broad-scale environmental context, local environmental context, environmental medium, geographic location (latitude) and geographic location (longitude), host metadata, sample collection metadata, etc.)
