title: Basics of Amplicon Quality Processing
description: Baic steps to do manually quality processing of 16S data step by step with individual tools instead of using integrated solutions like qiime2 / dada2 / deblur.
slug: basicsAmpliconQC
time_estimation: HM
questions:
  - What is quality processing and why it is important?
  - What are the neccessary steps to do quality processing on 16S amplicon data?
objectives:
  - You will be able to distinguish between different types of errors and bias in amplicon data.
  - You will apply different tools to address the different error types on the data.
  - You will compare the effect of quality processing with unporcessed data.  - 
key_points:
- The take-home messages
- They will appear at the end of the tutorial
